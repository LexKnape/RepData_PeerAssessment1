### **Loading and preprocessing the data**
```{r Loading and preprocessing the data}
# Load Libraries ddplyr and ggplot2
library("plyr")
library("ggplot2")
unzip("activity.zip")
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=T)
class(activity$date)
# factor Needs to be date
activityDate <-transform(activity, date = as.Date(date))
class(activityDate$date)
# Date
stepsPerDay <- ddply(activity, ~date, summarise, steps = sum(steps))
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
